# Diversity-Index

Women make up __half__ of the world's population, and despite the uproar over the lack of __diversity__ in the Computer Science field, they hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants in highly developed nations, especially in North America, Europe, and other first-world countries. There are hardly any avenues for helping women from `low- and middle-income countries` living in the [Least Developed Countries](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/49483614.pdf) (LDCs) as defined by the United Nations (UN).

This repo is an attempt to measure the __international diversity index__ when we talk of __diversity__ and __women__ - words that should encompass women from __all__ over the world, but a disparity of unequal proportions is created when diversity grants and financial aid opportunities are restricted to women who are citizens of the _first-world developed_ countries that have a higher earning parity based on their gross national income (GNI). Altruism to women who already enjoy facilities and privileges that women living in a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of, creates a dichotomy of unequals and this invisible inequality is deliberately ignored and never quantified by `women-in-tech` groups and the situation is worse in FOSS.

FOSS projects have a __"diversity"__ scarcity problem made more prominent due to the __lack of a CoC__, rather the reluctance to adopt one and implement it uniformly across all online FOSS communities within every country, resulting in a free pass to sexism, misogyny and online harassment, thereby directly impacting diversity. It is a known fact that merely adopting a CoC does [NOT create a safe space for conference attendees](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/a-code-of-conduct-is-not-enough), so its easy to imagine how easily this problem gets magnified in online spaces with 24x7x365 interactions, thereby ensuring a silent __leaky pipeline__ problem wherein existing women who leave Foss/ tech due to misogyny, harassment, subtle sexism and/or unequal pay and promotions are either never accounted for, or remain silent due to the lack of a support system.

The **[diversity-index](http://svaksha.github.io/diversity-index)** is a curated list of grants, scholarships, travel bursary and/or financial aid offered to women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) from __ALL around the world__, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__. To measure `diversity` accurately, lets first quantify __how__ much help is actually available to women across the world from the following pages:

+ [di-awards.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-awards.md) :: General grants and awards for Women in STEM, Post Doctoral Research grants and Scholarships and fellowships for women graduates interested in pursuing higher education in CS research and/or graduate studies at different Universities around the world.
+ [di-conf-events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-conf-events.md) :: Track the Diversity Index of women attending or speaking at barcamps, bootcamps, conferences, meetups, unconferences and other events thanks to financial aid and travel grants.
+ [di-internships.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-internships.md) :: Summer of Code programs and internships open to women applicants.
+ [di-resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-resources.md) :: Lists useful resources for conference speakers and diversity related information.

## Contributing
Please submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.

#### Guidelines for listing Events
+ This is NOT a generic list of events or conferences, hence, **only those conferences/ events that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) will be listed**.
+ Please dont list events that expect women to have protracted `diversity` discussions with the organizers to initiate the FA/grants programs as this places an extra burden on women to do the legwork of making their conference a success instead of `diversity` being a community effort. Reading @ashedryden 's article on "[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)" will give you a perspective of the challenges women in FOSS/IT face.
+ Please dont list research grants that promote ageism and/or discriminate and/or restrict applicants on the basis of age, if this information is known or publicly available.

#### Guidelines to submit a PR
+ Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
+ For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
+ For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the `diversity-index` repo and [edit the page by clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
